```properties
# gradle.properties (do not commit secrets)
RELEASE_STORE_FILE=/abs/path/to/keystore.jks
RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=****
RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=smarttube
RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=****
```
Then wire these into `signingConfigs` in `smarttubetv/build.gradle` and run:
```bash
./gradlew :smarttubetv:assembleStstableRelease
```

### Code Style
- No comments unless specifically requested
- Follow existing Android TV Leanback patterns
- Use existing utilities and libraries from the codebase
- Maintain consistency with current architecture

## Important Notes

- Security: Never include API keys, secrets, or sensitive data in commits.
- Compatibility: Android TV devices only â€” no phone/tablet/webOS/Tizen/iOS support.
- Build Requirements: Prefer JDK 11 for Gradle daemon.
- Git Submodules: Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` after cloning.
- Version Control: Always increment version numbers for new builds.
- APK Distribution: Only distribute through official channels, never app stores.
